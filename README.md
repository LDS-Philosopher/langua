# Langua

## Overview

Langua is a suite of language tools that can be used for testing, experimentation, learning, analysis, or creation. There are four main tools: [Gen](#gen), [Morph](#morph), [Deriv](#deriv), and [Frequen](#frequen).

### Gen

LanguaGen is a tool for automatically building a set of words based on arbitrary rules of phonotactics.

### Morph

LanguaMorph is a tool for modeling historical sound change according to arbitrary rules of phonetic change. It can also be used to reverse historical sound change according to those same rules in order to guess at a word's proto-language roots.

### Deriv

LanguaDeriv is a tool for modeling word derivation according to arbitrary rules of morphosyntactics.

### Frequen

LanguaFrequen is a tool for analyzing phoneme frequencies in a given text.

## Deployment

Langua is a web-based tool. The user interface is constructed using PHP, so it needs to be run on a server that can handle PHP.

Langua does not use a database, so it is extremely easy to install. Simply download the latest stable release and unpack it onto a server that will run it as a website.

**Note: Langua is currently under development and no stable release is yet ready.**
